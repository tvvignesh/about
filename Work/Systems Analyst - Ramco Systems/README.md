### My Activities @ HCM LABS, Ramco

1. Empsense - Web App
    
    Worked end to end on the web app of Empsense, an employee engagement solution from Ramco Systems where the goal was to help employees share how they feel at work. It was made in Node.js (Express), AngularJS, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Javascript. 
    
    It involved several components like APIs, Integrations with Microsoft Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Teams integration as a Tab, Bot & Connector, integration with Microsoft Graph APIs all packed with powerful features like Polls & Surveys, Contests, Mood-o-meter, Time & Attendance along with powerful dashboards.

2. Empsense - Hybrid App
    
    It was a hybrid mobile app made in Apache Cordova & IONIC. It was made  available as an Android App, IOS App, Chrome App, Electron App. All the apps were empowered with powerful notification features.

    Chrome APP was removed from store since Google deprecated it & Electron APP was not pushed to production.

3. Empsense - Chat Bot

    It was a chatbot primarily made available on MS Teams & Skype where employees could record their mood through the BOT, write posts & polls and share it with their colleagues right from there without navigating away.

4. JLT - Chat Bot

    It was a chatbot meant to be a personal assistant for people at work. I worked on integrating the bot with Evernote and was also responsible for restructuring the project structure to suit rapid development.

    `After I moved away from this project, major changes were made by the other teams and the tech stack was changed from NodeJS to C#`

### My Activities @ NGT, Ramco

1. SOAP to REST Transformation

    Was working on mapping the existing SOAP based application infrastructure to REST by the use of WSO2 API Manager & XSLT Transformations. 

    While this project was completed, it was not pushed to production due to security concerns.

2. Hearbeat Monitoring

    Worked on plotting the heartbeats from different servers & services coming at regular intervals as graphs and also made embeddable gadgets according to WSO2 Gadget Specifications. The server was written in NodeJS.

    While this project was completed, it was not pushed to production due to change in the thought process in the organization.

3. In Memory Data Grid (Caching) using Apache Ignite

    Worked on moving the existing MS SQL based database into Apache Ignite's in-memory system with persistence to disk enabled and was successful in doing so. Also wrote microservices which fetch the data from cache instead of the database.

    While the project was completed, it was abandoned due to data loss caused by the Apache Ignite tool on crash even with persistence to disk enabled.

4. Jasper Reporting

    Worked on generating JASPER reports end to end through REST APIs which involved loading JRXML, report unit, executing the report unit and finally loading the report. This activity was started since cross tabbing through Jasper initially took a lot of time for huge data set.

    The project has been completed but yet to be productionized.

5. GraphQL Implementation

    Worked on doing a proof of concept of a GraphQL implementation interacting with multiple data sources (a cache - Apache Geode, a database - MSSQL, a public api) in Node.js

    The project has been completed but yet to be productionized.

6. IVR & Voice Recognition with Twilio & Wit.ai

    Worked on an IVR implementation for various verticals in the organization where the caller interacts with the system through either voice or keypad in their phones to get data from the relevant database realtime. For speech, the text is extracted with twilio, sent to wit.ai for Natural language processing, intent is extracted and used to respond appropriately.

    The project has been completed and internal roll-out was done.

7. Central Notification Server

    Made a central notification server which can be used to make calls, send sms, send push notifications, send emails, call webhooks and pass data all through a single API.

    The project has been completed and being used for lot of projects as a dependency.

8. Tag Engine

    Made a tagging and search infrastructure using Node.js and Elasticsearch and allowed query through UI, SMS and E-mail to get the relevant info when searched for tags. 
    
    [Try the Search Engine](https://alpha.ramco.com/search.html)

9. Microsoft Flow & CDS

    Coordinated with the team and did a POC on ways to use Microsoft Flow to pull/push data to Microsoft Common Data Service to/from an organizational API. 

    The POC was completed and feedback was given to the product team.

10. Discrepancy Reporting (Machine Learning)

    Implemented an ability to report discrepancies with aircrafts and engines for MRO where repetitive discrepancies are ranked higher. Sentence similarity is used to identify repetitive discrepancies and they are clustered together. When reporting the discrepancy, the suggested corrective action is also auto-filled.

11. Monitoring, Alerting & Management

    Implemented monitoring of the various infrastructure components and projects in the organization using Prometheus, Grafana and Catchet and alerting with Push notifications, SMS, Call, etc. In addition to this, the ability to control and manage the server was also implemented when a failure occurs.

12. Autocodification for Aviation & Finance (Machine Learning)

    Implemented autofilling of fields based on the history data using Machine Learning for invoices in Aviation and Finance SBUs. Support vector Machines and clustering was used to get this done using Multi-label classification. The solution was implemented using a combination of Node.js and C.

13. Microservices Platform

    Implemented a Microservices Platform for the organization to use with orchestration, containers, Event Sourcing, etc.
